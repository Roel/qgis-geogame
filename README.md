# QGis demo plugin
This is a demo QGis plugin for an introductory course on developing QGis plugins (version 3.2).

For it to work you need a vector layer in your project with points having "name" and "wikipedia" attributes. The latter should be colon (:) separated between the language code and the page title (f.ex. "en:Wikipedia")
